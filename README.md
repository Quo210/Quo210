My name is Gabriel Rengifo.

I'm a 28 years old Software Engineer based on Venezuela, Latin America. I have a background in the healthcare industry, obtained my M.D. title back in 2018 and eventually migrated away from medicine and into tech. I've managed to balance family, work and life to fit in the journey of the programmer. 

I used to spend my day dealing with a sheet of pharmacological interactions but now I have a close friendship with JavaScript, a topic I knew little about and never expected to learn. Still, I hope to reach the point where I can truly reconcile my two passions into advancing the needs of new technologies in patient care and health by writing code.
