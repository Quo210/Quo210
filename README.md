My name is Gabriel.

I'm from Venezuela and I'm currently learning to code through the ODIN PROJECT and 100Devs. I already have a career in the health field but I'm not happy with its current condition in my country. I have always leaned a lot towards technology and I dream about combining what I already know along code and create a future for me and my family.
