My name is Gabriel Rengifo, an M.D. turned Software Engineer and Entrepreneur born and raised in Venezuela.

I graduated from medical college in 2018 and moved into work where I found little satisfaction within an industry ravaged by political and economical hardship in my nation. 

Just one year after graduation, I found myself unable to follow my desire to heal others while providing for my family, and without the means to migrate to another country like most of my colleagues. 

Feeling defeated I turned my gaze back to the passions that fueled my teen years before a white coat rested on my shoulders: tech. And unexpectedly I found a haven in writing lines of code. 

Skills in problem-solving, logic and step-to-step thinking that years in the emergency triage bestowed upon me transitioned into an intuitive learning journey.

With JavaScript as my new badge of office, I type into reality dreamed web projects and desired APIs, all from the quiet of my bedroom with my cat patiently watching me. 

However, the day I can truly reconcile my two passions into improved, safer healthcare aided by code and available to everyone is the goal I have set on my horizon.
